# Introduction

This package provides an API for host machines running python to interface with CTS Gen3 EVKs through their onboard FTDI I2C/SPI to USB chips.

It also provides documentation and types that can enable a host machine to interface with a CTS Gen3's Himax WiseEye 2 (WE2) chip directly over SPI or I2C.
